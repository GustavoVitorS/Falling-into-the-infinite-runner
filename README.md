# ⬜ Falling-into-the-infinite-runner ⬜
## ⬜ The project and the code was based on the JS-Infinite-Runner project, the current one has some changes in the script and ended up generating a difference in the animation.⬜
## ⬜ Although it was a "repurpose" of the previous project, I thought it was better to release it as a separate project than a new version, as both are different and deserve to remain that way.⬜
## ⬜ And of course, you can download both and apply the modifications and leave it the way you want, I created it and left it my way, but that doesn't stop you from doing as you see fit.⬜
